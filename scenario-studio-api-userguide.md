# Scenario Studio API v1 user guide

Scenario Studio API provides easy access to your project space in Scenario Studio (i.e. web-application for time-series models).  The API uses HMAC authentication and JSON responses, and the API doesnâ€™t depend on client's operating system and programming language. [Here!](https://api.economy.com/scenario-studio/v1/swagger/ui/index#/) is the main website to access the API. For curl and request URL, go to the relevant tab and fill-in the details. To access the API, ```R``` and ```python``` codes are available in our GitHub page. Various data fields, that can be accessed from existing workspace, are mentioned below. To get project content, the client may have to provide few project details (depending on the data field) that are mentioned in curl brackets. The corresponding text indicates the project content that can be accessed using the API.
