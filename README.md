# Scenario Studio API v2 Code Samples 

## Introduction
Scenario Studio is a web application for time-series models. The programs in this section will allow automatic access to facilitate integration of workflow with Scenario Studio. The Scenario Studio API supports both oAuth and HMAC authentication, and returns JSON responses, and doesn't depend on OS or programming language. The code samples are written ```Python``` in ```R``` and serve as a starting point to retrieve project content.

See [Scenario Studio API User Guide](https://github.com/moodysanalytics/scenario-studio.api.codesamples/blob/master/scenario-studio-api-userguide.pdf) for more information on using the API.

## Prerequisites

- A subscription to Scenario Studio
- Any operating system
- An appropriate development environment for your OS, for python or R
- Basic familiarity with the concepts of a web service API (our user guide PDF can get you started)
