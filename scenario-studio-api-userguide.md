# Moody's Analytics Scenario Studio API User Guide

_version 2.0.0_

## Introduction

Scenario Studio API provides easy programmatic control over Scenario Studio enabling process automation and workflow integration.  We provide a [Swagger API interface](https://api.economy.com/scenario-studio/v2/swagger/ui/index#/) to provide additional documentation and facilitate testing.  The Scenario Studio API supports both HMAC and oAuth 2.0 authentication and JSON responses, and is agnostic regarding the client’s operating system and programming language. The API is throttled (rate-limited) to 300 requests per minute and one gigabyte of data per month. The Swagger documentation examples express the requests in cURL notation, and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/moodysanalytics/scenario-studio.api.codesamples) contains examples in Python and R.

## Overview

The Scenario Studio v2 API core functions consist of several groups of endpoints for creating, editing, managing, and reading data and metadata from Scenario Studio projects.

* /audit/... - Retrieve content and counts of records in a project's audit log
* /project/... - Get metadata for a project, add and remove scenarios, and configure project settings
  * /project/.../scenario/... - Get metadata for a scenario, run solves, and configure settings
  * /project/.../data-series/... - Retrieve and push time series data to and from Scenario Studio
  * /project/.../scenario/.../series/... - Get series information, claim/release, change state, and customize equations
  * /project/.../search/ - Returns lists and counts of series within a project according to search parameters
* .../order/... - Get status of brokerized processes such as solves and project builds
* /base-scenario/... - Search and retrieve information about available base scenarios

## Authentication

The Scenarion Studio API supports 2 forms of authentication:

1. HMAC Signature
2. OAuth 2.0 Token

Both methods require Scenario Studio API access key and encryption key. Every request to the API must contain either an HMAC signature or OAuth Token.

### Getting API Keys

Access to the API is controlled by the combination of an access key and an encryption key. These keys are issued to a single user. To obtain your keys, go to the “My Subscriptions” section of your Economy.com account: https://www.economy.com/myeconomy/api-key-info.

##### Figure 1. Example access key and encryption key

```

## Using HMAC Authentication

### Authenticating each request

HMAC signature is generated from your access key, encryption key, and a time stamp. You must attach a signature to every request using HAMC authorization, and you must re-create the signature with every request; you will receive an HTTP 401 Unauthorized error otherwise.

The access key, time stamp and signature need to be passed in as HTTP headers (not as part of the query string). Do not transmit the encryption key in the request since it is a secret between you and the server.
Specifically, the signature is a SHA256 hash of the access key, encryption key and time stamp. The time stamp must be formatted as yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ using UTC. For example, “July 30, 2018 5:03:28pm EST” must be represented as 2018-07-30T21:03:28Z.

##### Figure 2. Example HTTP request header

```
AccessKeyId: DB73FDF0-043C-4018-A7EB-CFB57356BA22
TimeStamp: 2012-08-02T14:25:20Z
Signature: A7808C5A67C422054364F195B16175308317930848232C6A08A77224F1017E83
```

##### Figure 3. Example signature creation in C

This C# function creates a signature from an access key, encryption key, and time stamp. See the GitHub repository for samples using Python and R.

```c#
using System;
using System.Text;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
public static string CreateHMACSignature
(string accKey, string encKey, string timeStamp)
{
    string signature = string.Empty;
    byte[] keyBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(encKey);
    using (HMAC hmac = new HMACSHA256(keyBytes))
    {
        byte[] bytesToHash = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(accKey + timeStamp);
        byte[] hashedBytes = hmac.ComputeHash(bytesToHash);
        for (int i = 0; i < hashedBytes.Length; i++)
        {
            signature += hashedBytes[i].ToString("X2");
        }
    }
    return signature;
}
```

## Using OAuth authentication.

oAuth Token can be generated by calling an API endpoint, using API access key as *client_id* and API encryption key as *client_secret* and it will remain valid for 1 hour. You must include token in header of every request using OAuth authorization.

### Obtaining OAuth Token

The _oauth2/token_ endpoint is used to generate oAuth Token using your *access key as client_id, encryption key as client_secret and grant_type as client_credentials*. The following cURL request can be used to obtain an OAuth token.

##### Figure 4. Request

```
curl -X POST \
  https://api.economy.com/scenario-studio/v1/oauth2/token \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -d 'client_id=DB73FDF0-043C-4018-A7EB-CFB57356BA22' \
  -d 'client_secret=47C7C2FEA-6D18-49A1-BEC9-193B67EAE87D' \
  -d 'grant_type=client_credentials'
```

The response to the above request will have a new access token.

##### Figure 5. Respone

```
{
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "access_token": "SrZ5UkbzPn432zqMLgV3Ja",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
```

A request to API will have **Authorization: Bearer _token_** as header

##### Figure 6. Call to API endpoint using oAuth Token

```
curl -X GET \
  'https://api.economy.com/scenario-studio/v1/project' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer SrZ5UkbzPn432zqMLgV3Ja'
```

### What programming languages does the API support?

The programming language used at your end is immaterial, so long as it (a) creates HTTP requests that the API can process, and (b) can interpret the JSON-formatted responses produced by the API. The examples provided in this document and in the GitHub repository use cURL, Python and R.

### What response types are supported?

JSON is the only response type returned by the API.

### Can I use the API from Linux?

Yes, because the operating system is immaterial. Java, Python and R are commonly used on Linux machines; to run C#, you will need to install the .NET Core framework. Setting up your run-time environment is beyond the scope of this document.

### What kind of authentication does the API use?

Our API uses HMAC and OAuth 2.0 authentication. See the Authentication section above for more info.

### How often do I need to regenerate the HMAC signature?

You must re-create the signature prior to every request; otherwise you will receive the “HTTP 401 Unauthorized” error. You may find it useful to create a wrapper function that takes the time stamp, access key and encryption key as arguments, and generates a signature immediately before calling the endpoint.

### How often do I need to regenerate the oAuth 2.0 token?

Once generated the oAuth token is valid for 1 hour and can be used for multiple requests.

### Is the API throttled?

Yes, in two ways. First, you can execute 300 requests per minute per account (but a single request can retrieve one series or a basket containing thousands of series). You will receive “HTTP 429 Too Many Requests” error. Second, you can retrieve only one gigabyte of data per month. This includes all of the metadata and HTTP headers, although these are insignificant relative to the data payload. The number of requests and series are not specifically limited.

### Can I use the API to populate a data warehouse?

Yes. You may create a data warehouse for internal use, but the number of users who may have access to it is stipulated by your contract; please contact your Moody’s Analytics sales representative if you have questions.

### What kind of Scenario Studio information can I retrieve?

The API can return Scenario Studio project, scenario, and series details and metadata, as well as series data.

### Can I create or alter a project or scenario?

Yes. The Scenario Studio v2 API now includes endpoints that enable project creation, scenario editing, and solving.

### How should date parameters be constructed?

Date parameters sent to API endpoints should be integers, defined as the number of periods since Dec 31 1849. For a quarterly series, this translates to 1850Q1=1, 1850Q2=2, etc. For a monthly series this is Jan1850=1, Feb1850=2, etc.

### How many series can I retrieve with the data-series endpoint?

There is no hard limit on the number of series that can be retrieved with the POST version of the data-series endpoint. However, there is a practical limit when requests become too large there is a chance of a error 504 gateway timeout. When using the GET version of the data-series endpoint, there is the additional limit of query string length.

### If I alter the name of a project using the Scenario Studio web application, do I need to change my code?

No. The /project/{projectid} endpoint identifies a project by an immutable alphanumeric GUID that is assigned by our system, not the
human-readable title assigned by you.

### Whom do I contact for assistance in using the API?

Please go to the Economy.com [Contact Us](https://www.economy.com/about/contact-us) page for email, chat, and telephone options. If using the email form, set Topic to “Technical Issue.”

### Do other Moody’s Analytics products have APIs?

Yes. We also provide APIs for our Data Buffet, AutoCycle, and Précis products.

### I don’t understand this jargon—can you translate?

Please see if the glossary in this document helps. It lists terminology pertaining to web APIs and related Moody’s Analytics products.

## Glossary

**access key:** Part of the credentials used to access the Scenario Studio API. A unique 36-character hexadecimal string, which is combined with the encryption key (qv) to produce the signature (qv).

**API:** Application programming interface. Generically, a set of function signatures (input and output parameters) to perform documented behavior. See also: web API (qv).

**AutoCycle:** See: Moody’s AutoCycle™ (qv).

**Coordinated Universal Time:** A civil time standard based on atomic clocks and astronomical measurements, and an associated representation using a 24-hour clock that includes year, month, day, hour, minute and second, and fixed punctuation. The format is yyyymm-ddThh:mm:ssZ, for example, 2018-07-30T21:03:28Z. This format is used when making requests to the Scenario Studio API(qv). A.k.a. universal coordinated time, universal time coordinated, UTC.

**cURL:** Client for URLs. An open-source command-line software application to demonstrate HTTP (qv) requests and responses. Its syntax is often used to concisely document the behavior of web APIs (qv). See: curl.haxx.se

**CreditCycle:** see: Moody’s CreditCycle™ (qv).

**CSV:** Comma-Separated Value. A file format that consists of plain text, where fields are separated by comma characters, and records are separated by line breaks.

**encryption key:** Part of the credentials used to access the Scenario Studio API. A unique 36-character hexadecimal string, which is combined with the access key (qv) to produce the signature (qv).

**end point:** In a web API (qv), a unique, static URL that represents an object or collection of objects; to interact with these resources, you point an HTTP client (qv) at the endpoint.

**GUID:** Globally Unique Identifier. GUIDs are used in enterprise software development as database keys, component identifiers, and in COM programming; they are generated by individual users with an algorithm that virtually guarantees uniqueness. A GUID is a 128-bit integer, commonly expressed as a 32-character hexadecimal string delimited by hyphens. In the Scenario Studio API, access and encryption keys, and basket and order identifiers, are GUIDs. A.k.a. Universally Unique Identifier, UUID.

**HMAC:** Hash-based Message Authentication Code. An international software standard (RFC2104 et seq) to verify the integrity of information transmitted over an unreliable medium such as the internet.

**HTTP:** HyperText Transfer Protocol. An international software standard (RFC2616 et seq) for an application-layer, client-server, stateless protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents and control information. See: https://www.w3.org/Protocols/, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP

**HTTP client:** Software that can communicate via HTTP (qv) with a server, for example, a web browser, cURL (qv), or a custom application that queries a web API (qv).

**JSON:** JavaScript Object Notation: An international software standard (ECMA-404), a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for software to parse and generate, for humans to read and write, and is programming language-independent. JSON is the format in which the Scenario Studio API (qv) delivers individual time series (qv) and basket output (qv). See: www.json.org.

**MIME:** Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension. An international software standard (RFC2045 et seq) that identifies how a file transmitted over the internet (as by email or HTTP) should be interpreted by the recipient.

**metadata:** Structured data that describes other data.

**Moody’s AutoCycle™:** A software solution to forecast car prices, incorporating economic data and scenarios from Moody’s Analytics. See: https://www.economy.com/products/data/autocycle

**Moody’s CreditCycle™:** A software solution to model consumer credit risk; it combines customer data, economic data from Moody’s Analytics, and consumer credit data from Equifax. See: https://www.economy.com/products/consumer-credit-analytics/moodys-creditcycle

**OAuth:** An open software standard (RFC5849 et seq) for services over HTTP to provide “secure delegated access” whereby server owners authorize third-party access without the clients sharing their credentials.

**observation:** Each numeric measurement in a time series (qv).

**rate limiting:** With a web API (qv), a policy that controls how many requests from a given user will be processed per unit of time, typically for billing purposes or to promote adequate performance for all users.
